MATVEC computes a matrix-vector product c = A * b.
Giving each process a copy of the vector b, and using self-scheduling to let any process have the next row of A to work on when it is ready. 
Arrays are allocated dynamically. 
The "math.h" include file is needed, as is the run-time math library.

matvec_mpi.c, the source code;
matvec.sh, a script to compile and run the program using MPIRUN.
matvec_output.txt, the output file;
matvec_fsu.sh, a script to compile and run the program on the FSU HPC cluster.
matvec_fsu_output.txt, the output file;
